=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::Strawberry::Repository - The repository that is used for Perl::Dist::Strawberry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the repository that Perl::Dist::Strawberry uses, 
and the branches that are currently being used as of January 2010.

=head1 REPOSITORY

Perl::Dist::Strawberry is currently on Adam Kennedy's "Open Repository" for 
CPAN authors, at L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/>

My understanding is that if you're a CPAN author, you can get commit access 
to it by asking Adam Kennedy for it. His e-mail address is 
C<< adamk@cpan.org >>.

If you aren't a CPAN author and need commit access for Perl::Dist::Strawberry, 
please e-mail me with what you'd like to do (a patch would be nice to see) and 
I'll recommend to him that you be given access.

In any case, before committing anything more than minor changes to the 
Perl-Dist-Strawberry trunk or branches, please e-mail me.  I'll probably say 
yes, but I need to know what you're planning to do, so that I don't accidentally 
step on your changes.

You may wish to work on your own branch, and then communicate with me to get it 
merged into the trunk, by doing:

	svn cp http://svn.ali.as/trunk/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/ http://svn.ali.as/branches/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/<branch_name>

=head1 BRANCHES

The trunk is currently in the process of polishing for a January 2010
release of Strawberry Perl.

Here are the branches:

=head2 Trunk 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/>

The trunk is currently working with Perl::Dist::WiX 1.101.

=head2 Maintenance 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/branches/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/October-2009-maintenance/>

This is a maintenance branch for use only if there is a major bug that 
requires a re-release of the October 2009 version of Strawberry Perl.

This branch will be deleted once the January 2010 version is released, 
and a new maintenance branch will be created at that time.
