=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::Strawberry::Repository - The repository that is used for Perl::Dist::Strawberry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the repository that Perl::Dist::Strawberry uses, 
and the branches that are currently being used as of October 2009.

=head1 REPOSITORY

Perl::Dist::Strawberry is currently on Adam Kennedy's "Open Repository" for 
CPAN authors, at L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/>

If you're a CPAN author, you can get commit access by asking Adam 
Kennedy for it. His e-mail address is C<< adamk@cpan.org >>.

If you aren't a CPAN author and need commit access for Perl::Dist::Strawberry, 
please e-mail both Adam and I (Curtis Jewell, C<< csjewell@cpan.org >>) with 
what you'd like to do (a patch would be nice to see, but it isn't required).

In any case, If you would like to make significant changes or improvements to the 
Perl-Dist-Strawberry trunk or maintenance branches, please e-mail me.

You may wish to work on your own branch, and then communicate with me to get it 
merged into the trunk, by doing:

	svn cp http://svn.ali.as/trunk/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/ http://svn.ali.as/branches/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/<branch_name>

=head1 BRANCHES

Here is the list of current branches:

=head2 Trunk (think of this as equivalent to perl's "blead")

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/trunk/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/>

The trunk is currently working with Perl::Dist::WiX 1.100, although this will 
change soon, as the ability to build 64-bit .msi's and make a relocatable .msi 
will start to filter in to both this module and Perl::Dist::WiX.

=head2 "October 2009 Maintenance" 

Location: L<http://svn.ali.as/cpan/branches/Perl-Dist-Strawberry/October-2009-maintenance/>

This branch, as its name states, is the maintenance branch for 5.10.1.0 and 
5.8.9.3 - it will only be updated to fix major problems in those releases.

Perl-Dist-Strawberry 2.01 was released off of this branch.
