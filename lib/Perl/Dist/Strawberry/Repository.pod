=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::Strawberry::Repository - The repository that is used for Perl::Dist::Strawberry.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This documentation describes the repository that Perl::Dist::WiX uses, and 
the branches that are currently being used as of May 2011.

=head1 REPOSITORY

Perl::Dist::WiX is currently on Curtis Jewell's Mercurial repository, at 
L<http://hg.curtisjewell.name/Perl-Dist-WiX>

After mercurial revision 361 on that repository (svn revision r14442) changes 
will not be mirrored to svn.ali.as.

If you need push access for Perl::Dist::WiX, please e-mail me with what 
you'd like to do (a patch would be nice) and I'll give you access.

=head1 BRANCHES

The trunk will soon be in the process of adding capabilities for the
next release of Strawberry Perl.

Here are the branches:

=head2 default 

The trunk is currently working with Perl::Dist::WiX 2.500.

Pluggability has been added. Because of this, the Perl patches are in separate 
distributions now, in the Perl::Dist::Strawberry::BuildPerl:: namespace.

Another goal is to add 5.14.0 support to the trunk and extend the pluggability 
more.

=head2 maint-May2011 (May 2011 maintenance branch.)

This branch exists for the sole purpose of rebuilding Strawberry Perl 5.10.1 
and 5.12.3 if there are major problems before August 2011. Changes on this 
branch are HIGHLY discouraged.

This branch will be deleted once the next version is released, 
and a new maintenance branch will be created at that time.
