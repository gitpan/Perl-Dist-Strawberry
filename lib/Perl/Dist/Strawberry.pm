=head1 NAME

Perl::Dist::Strawberry - Strawberry Perl for win32

=head1 VERSION

This is 0.1.2, corresponding to Strawberry Perl 5.8.8 Alpha 2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Strawberry Perl is currently an alpha release and is not recommended 
for production purposes.>

Strawberry Perl is a binary distribution of Perl for the Windows operating
system.  It includes a bundled compiler and pre-installed modules that offer
the ability to install XS CPAN modules directly from CPAN.  

The purpose of the Strawberry Perl series is to provide a practical Win32 Perl
environment for experienced Perl developers to experiment with and test the
installation of various CPAN modules under Win32 conditions, and to provide a
useful platform for doing real work.

Strawberry Perl includes:

=over

=item *

Perl 5.8.8

=item *

Mingw GCC C/C++ compiler

=item *

Dmake "make" tool

=item *

L<ExtUtils::CBuilder> and L<ExtUtils::ParseXS>

=item *

L<Bundle::CPAN> (including Perl modules that largely eliminate the need for
external helper programs like C<gzip> and C<tar>)

=item *

L<Bundle::LWP> (providing more reliable http CPAN repository support)

=item *

Additional Perl modules that enhance the stability of core Perl for the
Win32 platform

=back

The Perl::Dist::Strawberry distribution on CPAN contains programs and
instructions for downloading component sources and assembling them into the
executable installer for Strawberry Perl.  It B<does not> include the resulting
Strawberry Perl installer itself.  

See L</"DOWNLOADING THE INSTALLER"> for instructions on where to download and
how to install Strawberry Perl.  

See L<Perl::Dist::Build> at L<http://search.cpan.org> for details on 
the builder used to create Strawberry Perl from source.

=head1 CHANGES FROM CORE PERL

Strawberry Perl is and will continue to be based on the latest "stable" release
of Perl, currently version 5.8.8.  Some additional modifications are included
that improve general compatibility with the Win32 platform or improve
"turnkey" operation on Win32.  

Whenever possible, these modifications will be made only by preinstalling
additional CPAN modules within Strawberry Perl, particularly modules that have
been newly included as core Perl modules in the "development" branch of perl
to address Win32 compatibility issues.

Modules or distributions currently included are:

=over

=item *

ExtUtils::MakeMaker 6.30_01 -- fixes a Win32 perl path bug

=item *

CPAN 1.87_57 -- many small fixes for numerous annoyances on Win32

=item * 

Win32API::File -- to allow for deletion of in-use files at next reboot;
required for CPAN.pm to be able to upgrade itself

=item *

IO -- to address Win32 Socket bugs
    
=item *

Compress::Zlib, IO::Zlib and Archive::Tar -- to eliminate the CPAN.pm
dependency on external, binary programs to handle .tar.gz files

=item *

Archive::Zip (and its dependency, Time::Local) -- to eliminate the CPAN.pm
dependency on external, binary programs to handle .zip files

=item *

libnet -- provides Net::FTP to eliminate the CPAN.pm dependency on an external,
binary ftp program; installed configured for FTP passive mode

=back

Additionally, a stub CPAN Config.pm file is installed.  It provides defaults
to the path for dmake, to automatically follow dependencies and to use the
Windows temporary directory for the CPAN working directory. 

=head1 DOWNLOADING THE INSTALLER

Strawberry Perl is available from L<http://vanillaperl.com/>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

At present, Strawberry Perl must be installed in C:\strawberry-perl.  The
executable installer adds the following environment variable changes:

    * adds directories to PATH
        - C:\strawberry-perl\perl\bin  
        - C:\strawberry-perl\dmake\bin
        - C:\strawberry-perl\mingw
        - C:\strawberry-perl\mingw\bin

    * adds directories to LIB
        - C:\strawberry-perl\mingw\lib
        - C:\strawberry-perl\perl\bin

    * adds directories to INCLUDE 
        - C:\strawberry-perl\mingw\include 
        - C:\strawberry-perl\perl\lib\CORE 
        - C:\strawberry-perl\perl\lib\encode

LIB and INCLUDE changes are likely more than are necessary, but attempt to
head off potential problems compiling external programs for use with Perl.

Users installing Strawberry Perl manually without the installer will need to
change their environment variables manually.

The first time that the "cpan" program is run, users will be prompted for
configuration settings.  With the defaults provided in Strawberry Perl, users
may answer "no" to manual configuration and the installation should still work.

Manual CPAN configuration may be repeated by running the following command:

    perl -MCPAN::FirstTime -e "CPAN::FirstTime::init"
