### add CreateReleaseNotes

### save tool versions
- gcc, dmake, ... version into ->{data}->{output}
- perl -V output
- maybe part of CreateReleaseNotes

### test 64bit 5.14.2.1 build
- needs new share/64bits-5.14.2.1.pp file

### test MSI major upgrade feature
- it did not work in official 5.14.2.1 MSI (so not critical)

### CPANPLUS
- setup our own URL list
- consider removing c:\strawberry\cpanplus - keep it in user profile

### CPANPLUS_install_module.pl 
- how to pass multiple args via makefilepl_param, buildpl_param

### ppm.xml
- old 5.12 repos
- perhaps different xml for 32/64bit versions

### Portable::Dist needs fix
- depends on Tie-Slurp-0.03 which is not on CPAN anymore
- pip http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/I/IS/ISHIGAKI/Tie-Slurp-0.03.tar.gz

### decide about (not)including: perl/vendor/lib/auto/DBD/mysql/libmysql_.dll

### check for XXX FIXME TODO in the code

### MSI has in fact 2 different welcome strings
- we have 4digit version only in the second one
<String Id="WelcomeDlgTitle">{\WixUI_Font_Bigger}Welcome to the [ProductName] [Version4digit] Setup Wizard</String> 
<String Id="WelcomeDlgTitle">{\WixUI_Font_Bigger}Welcome to the Setup Wizard for&#13;&#10;[ProductName] [Version4digit]</String>
<String Id="PrepareDlgTitle">{\WixUI_Font_Bigger}Welcome to the Setup Wizard for&#13;&#10;[ProductName] [Version4digit]</String>

##### 64bit update_env.pl.bat
- set ENV without reboot - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3837014/how-do-i-set-an-win32-system-environment-variable-in-perl
- 32bit works fine (maybe a bug in Win32::API)

### modules (non critical)
- DB_File - disable in core (install later in vendor)
- FCGI - is installed in perl/lib (during UpgradeCpanModules) as it is required by CGI

### App::strawberry::ppm
- updated ppm utility (fix to handle new repos)

### improve CreateRelocFiles
- search all in perl/bin (test for text/binary via -t)
- search *.url in image_dir
- search *.pm in image_dir

### perltoc.pod contains hardcoded paths to build directory
- not a new bug

### something better instead of workaround_get_dist_list()
- is kind of a hack (somehow works, not reliable)
