### MSI upgrade code
- take values from last 5.14. releases
- should be different for 32/64bit

### add CreateReleaseNotes
- need ttvars
  build_date '22 Nov 2011'
  dist_list (HTML fragment or array) - maybe ugly hack based on env\AppDataRoaming\.cpanplus\authors\id\*
  dist_pkgs (HTML fragment or array) - see _get_dist_pkgs in old Perl-Dist-WiX\lib\Perl\Dist\WiX\Mixin\ReleaseNotes.pm
- MSM info file
- maybe save tool versions
  gcc, dmake, ... version into ->{data}->{output}
  perl -V output

### test MSI major upgrade feature
- it did not work in official 5.14.2.1 MSI (so not critical)

### CPANPLUS
- consider removing c:\strawberry\cpanplus - keep it in user profile

### ppm.xml
- old 5.12 repos
- perhaps different xml for 32/64bit versions

### Portable::Dist needs fix
- depends on Tie-Slurp-0.03 which is not on CPAN anymore
- pip http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/I/IS/ISHIGAKI/Tie-Slurp-0.03.tar.gz

--- LATER ---

### skipping based on global->{target} is not optimal
- it does not skip all portable-related tasks
- we perhaps need to have a new config item e.g. 
  required_by_targets=>'zip+msi+portable'
  required_by_targets=>'zip'
  required_by_targets=>'msi'
  required_by_targets=>'portable'

### CPANPLUS_install_module.pl 
- how to pass multiple args via makefilepl_param, buildpl_param

### decide about (not)including: perl/vendor/lib/auto/DBD/mysql/libmysql_.dll
- not for now

### check for XXX FIXME TODO in the code
- ok for now

##### 64bit update_env.pl.bat
- set ENV without reboot - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3837014/how-do-i-set-an-win32-system-environment-variable-in-perl
- 32bit works fine (maybe a bug in Win32::API)

### modules (non critical)
- DB_File - disable in core (install later in vendor)
- FCGI - is installed in perl/lib (during UpgradeCpanModules) as it is required by CGI

### App::strawberry::ppm
- updated ppm utility (fix to handle new repos)

### improve CreateRelocFiles
- search all in perl/bin (test for text/binary via -t)
- search *.url in image_dir
- search *.pm in image_dir

### perltoc.pod contains hardcoded paths to build directory
- not a new bug

### something better instead of workaround_get_dist_list()
- is kind of a hack (somehow works, not reliable)
