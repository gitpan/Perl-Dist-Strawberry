NAME
    Perl::Dist::Strawberry - build strawberry-perl-like distribution for MS
    Windows

DESCRIPTION
    Strawberry Perl is a binary distribution of Perl for the Windows
    operating system. It includes a bundled compiler and pre-installed
    modules that offer the ability to install XS CPAN modules directly from
    CPAN.

    The purpose of the Strawberry Perl series is to provide a practical
    Win32 Perl environment for experienced Perl developers to experiment
    with and test the installation of various CPAN modules under Win32
    conditions, and to provide a useful platform for doing real work.

    Perl::Dist::Strawberry is just a helper module for the main script
    perldist_strawberry.
